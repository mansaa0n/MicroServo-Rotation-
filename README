General info. (Understanding servos)
  Servos are used in variety of applications such as Robots. Moreover, the micro servo used
  in this assignment can be controlled by the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal sent to it. In
  explaining how it works, we can think of HIGH and LOW signals sent to the motor, this high
  and low signal will generate a pulse, in the servos case this pulse has to be within a width of
  time in order for the movement to happen. So, for example in case you want to move the servo
  90 degrees, you need to send high signal for certain amount of time then you need to send low
  signal right after this delay of time.
